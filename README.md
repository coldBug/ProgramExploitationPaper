# ProgramExploitaion
A 10 pages paper written for the 'seminar' computer science master class at university of applied sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. All explained programs and exploits are available in the 'exploits' subfolder.

Abstract - Memory exploitation countermeasures are widely deployed on modern systems to prevent the exploitation of programming flaws. This paper provides an insight into advanced exploitation techniques and how they circumvent these protection mechanisms. By doing so, it outlines how these techniques take advantage of program flaws to circumvent those countermeasures. A special focus lies on the correlations between these measures and how they raise the requirements for a successful exploitation. As proofed in this paper, programs with all countermeasures enabled are still exploitable, although more than one program flaw is needed to do so.
